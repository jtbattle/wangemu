<h1>WangEmu Disk Factory</h1>

<p>
The disk factory is used to create new disks, or to inspect
and optionally modify existing disks.  The disk factory operates in
one of two modes, depending on which way it is invoked, both of which are
located in the main menu bar Disk item:
</p>

<p><img src="img/menu_disk.png"  height="100" width="146" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#new">New Disk...</a></li>
    <li><a href="#inspect">Inspect Disk...</a></li>
    <li><a href="#format">Format Disk...</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
These functions are also accessible from the disk drive icons shown on the
lower left hand corner of the window.
While holding down the Ctrl key,
left click on an occupied drive to invoke the disk inspector dialog.
</p>

<p><img src="img/status_disks.png"  height="38" width="188" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
Another way to invoke the disk factory is by invoking a context menu
on the disk drive icon.  An empty drive has a different context menu
than an occupied drive.
While holding down the Ctrl key, right click on a
drive icon.
</p>

<p><img src="img/disk_popup1.png"  height="97" width="166" alt="placeholder" /></p>
<p><img src="img/disk_popup2.png"  height="75" width="196" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
This is not specific to the disk factory, but while discussing this bit
of the interface, it is worth noting that hovering the mouse pointer over
a disk drive will produce a balloon window stating either how to insert
a disk (if the drive is empty), or describing which disk is currently in
the drive, if occupied.
</p>


<h2><a name="new">New Disk</a></h2>

<p>
When invoked in this mode, the dialog looks like this:
</p>

<p><img src="img/factory_new.png"  height="376" width="416" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
Although the emulator can accept many formats of disks with differing
number of platters, sectors per platter, and timing profile, the dialog
displays a number of common real configurations, plus a couple to fill
the gaps (for instance, I don't believe a DS-224 was ever made, but it
is about the largest possible disk in Wang BASIC-2).
</p>

<p>
The top left "Disk Type" buttons select which of the disk configurations
to make.  The physical size (5.25" or 8") is irrelevant to the emulator,
but it is represents how the actual 5.25" and 8" Wang
floppy disks were configured.
</p>

<p>
To the right are the "Disk Properties".  For a chosen disk type,
this area shows exactly what that means in terms of the number of sectors
on the disk, the number of sectors per track, the track to track stepping
time, and the disk speed.  The emulator can be configured to ignore
the timing related parameters and to just run as if the disk drive was
infinitely fast, but the number of sectors per disk is always important.
</p>

<p>
Beneath these areas exists a write protect checkbox.  By checking
the box, it won't be possible for the emulator to modify the disk state,
akin to the write protect tab on a floppy disk.
</p>

<p>
Most likely it is useful to supply a label for the disk (described below)
before saving the new disk image to the real file system.
</p>

<p>
After setting everything up, click on "Save As" to specify where to
put the disk and what name it should have.
</p>

<h2><a name="inspect">Inspect Disk</a></h2>

<p>
The disk inspection mode can be used to view properties of the disk, such
as size, its label, and its write protection status.  It looks like
this:
</p>

<p><img src="img/factory_inspect.png"  height="297" width="416" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
It looks very much like the New Disk mode, with a few changes.
</p>

<p>
First, there is now a "path" description.  It says where the virtual
disk image is located.
</p>

<p>
Second, there is no "Disk Type" region.  Instead, the Disk Properties
region is sufficient to describe the disk's attributes.  These attributes
can't be changed after the disk has been made.
</p>

<p>
What can be changed are the disks write protection status and the disk
label.  The changes can only be saved back to the same disk image;
there is no way to save it to a different filename.
</p>

<h2><a name="label">Disk Label</a></h2>

<p>
To view or modify the disk label from either "New Disk" or "Inspect Disk"
modes, select the second tab, and you will see something like this:
</p>

<p><img src="img/factory_label.png"  height="297" width="416" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
This tab lets you view the label, but you are also free to modify it,
or to copy a selection from it to the system clipboard.
</p>

<h2><a name="format">Format Disk</a></h2>

<p>
An existing virtual disk image can be formatted quickly by using this menu
option.  It simply writes all sectors of the disk to 00 bytes.
