---- What is It? ----

This emulates a Wang 2200 system with a choice of five CPU architectures:

    * 2200B     (1st generation 2200, with a somewhat limited command set)
    * 2200T     (the highest end of the 1st generation 2200's)
    * 2200VP    (2nd generation CPU)
    * 2200MVP-C (2nd generation CPU, w/multiple users and 64K word ucode store)
    * MicroVP   (3rd generation CPU, supporting up to 8MB of data RAM)

and a number of peripherals:

    * 6312 (64x16) and 7011 (80x24) CRT controllers
    * 6367 keyboard controller
    * MXD terminal mux, connected to one to four 2236 terminals
    * either dumb or intelligent disk controller, capable of modeling any
      2270 floppy disk, 2260 hard disk, and 2280 large hard disk subsystems
    * configurable printer controller

The emulator is primarily written under Windows 7, but it should also run
under Windows Vista, Windows 8, and Windows 10 as well. This emulator
is untested under Windows XP and probably does not run.

It has also been ported to OSX, though due to compatibility churn on that
platform, it doesn't run on older versions of the OS.

The emulator very well might run on Linux via Wine, as that worked with
older versions of the emulator, but it hasn't been tested for 3.0 at the
time of its release.

---- User-visible Changes ----

*) There is support for more system CPU configurations:
       2200B, 2200T, 2200VP, 2200MVP-C (new), and MicroVP (new)
   Correspondingly, there are appropriate system RAM size options available
   for each CPU type.

*) Added emulation of a 2236MXD terminal mux and 2236DE terminal.
   Why MXD and not MXE? One good reason is that OS's before 2.4 would not
   run with an MXE terminal mux.

   When not emulating a smart terminal, the host computer's TAB key maps
   to the Wang BASIC "NEXT STMT" key, which in Wang BASIC inserts the next
   highest unused line number (rounded up to the next 10). For smart
   terminals, TAB maps to the TAB or FN key (depending if DW or DE terminal).

*) It is now possible to run MVP OS's, but of course the system configuration
   must have one 2236MXD terminal mux installed.

*) Because the addition of 2336 terminal emulation, the keyboard map has
   had some new key mappings added, and some old ones have been changed.
   Most significantly:

   - Previously, Alt-R would do a hard reset of the emulator, akin to power
     cycling. Because this operation should be infrequent, the lack of a
     keyboard shortcut shouldn't be noticed. The hard reset operation is
     still available from the CPU menu, and is called "Reboot CPU".

   - Previously, Alt-W would do a warm reset of the emulator, analogous to
     pressing the RESET button on a 2200T terminal or the SHIFT-RESET key on
     a serial terminal. It is now mapped to Shift-Alt-R. Adding the shift
     qualifier makes is harder to accidentally trigger, and moving it to "R"
     is more mnemonic for "reset."

   - Ctrl-S is now used for Halt/Step. Previously it was Ctlr-C, but that
     is now used to map the CLEAR key.

   - Ctrl-L is now used for LOAD. Previously it was used for LIST.

   Consult the Keyboard Help entry from the top level Help menu to review
   all the mappings.

*) Before release 3.0, the emulator had the option of using a fixed-width
   system font to display characters instead of using the dot matrix font.
   This has been removed because the original font had a number of characters
   which don't have a good representation in a standard font.  The long-term
   goal is to rewrite the display generating code and the native font idea
   doesn't map into that well at all.

*) The option to control whether disk accesses are performed at the same
   speed as a real 2200 ("realtime") or quickly ("unregulated") used to be
   a checkbox item on the system configuration dialog. Now it appears in
   a more logical place (and easier to access), the Disk menu.

*) Previously, printing HEX(07) produced a default bell-like sound.
   Now the emulator emits a sound very much like a real Wang terminal.
   (see limitation of OSX port in the "Known Bugs" section)

*) Previously, the emulator could be launched like this:
      wangemu.exe -s somescript.w22
   and the name script would be fed into the emulator. But that isn't
   useful now (if it ever was) for (M)VP systems, which must be configured
   before they can run a program. Now it ignores the command line arguments.

---- Bugs Fixed in this Release ----

*) Wang disk controllers supported "hog mode", where a given CPU could
   lock a disk drive for exclusive use, mostly to ensure atomic r/w
   behavior. Wangemu doesn't emulate multiple systems, so there is no
   need to emulate a disk mux, but there is one facet which was missing.
   One method of triggering hog mode was to address the drive with the
   high bit of the address set, eg /310 would become /390. So now the
   emulator ignores the most significant I/O address bit when doing
   address decode, but no other aspect of hog mode is emulated.

*) Some disk controllers supported more advanced commands than just the
   basic read sector, write sector, verify sector. In fact, a few of
   them were implemented for "intelligent" disk controller mode. Recently
   unearthed internal Wang documentation showed that the VERIFY_SECTORS
   command response contained a three byte sector address, not two bytes,
   as was previously emulated. However, I've had a hard time triggering
   BASIC to actually use this feature, so it is really not yet tested.

*) If the disk controller receives a channel command which is either not
   implemented or is unknown, a warning dialog will appear stating as much,
   but a given bad command byte will only trigger the warning once, to
   keep from becoming intrusive. Also, in accordance with the Wang internal
   documentation, a bad command byte is echoed back with all bits inverted
   so that the microcode can detect it and abort the command.

*) The disk controller would assert if it received an unexpected value for
   the first byte of the command sequence. Because $GIO programs can send
   anything at all, the assert was removed and the other values get mapped
   to assume a VP or MVP host if the first byte isn't 0x00.

*) the "Disk/New Disk..." disk factory allowed specifying DS-112, DS-140,
   or DS-224 disk drive types. These attempted to create disks with 65536
   sectors/track, but this would cause an assertion, as 65535 is the maximum
   sector address which can be specified with a 16b number.

*) The legal sizes of data RAM for 2200VP CPUs was wrong, and is now matches
   what was historically accurate. It used to be configuring a VP in the
   emulator with 16 KB or 48 KB of RAM would trigger an assertion.

*) When using ramdisk (/340), the emulator no longer warns about accesses
   to an unmapped device address.

*) When the cpu switched between addressed devices (via ABS), it wasn't
   updating the selected card with the current CBP status. most of the time it
   did't matter, but it did when a reboot happened with a 2236MXD terminal in
   the system.

*) The CRT controller had a long-standing bug where a hard reset was failing
   to restore the cursor enable flag. Say a program had done PRINT HEX(06)
   to disable the cursor, after a hard reset the cursor was still disabled.

*) There is no functional change, but the timing modeling for 5.25" floppies
   had been assuming a 2:1 sector interleave, but it turns out the actual
   interleave is 3:1.  I had figured this out 15 years prior, but that
   information never made it into the emulator and I had forgotten I had even
   figured it out.

---- Minor Tweaks and Implementation Changes ----

*) compiled with the latest wxWidgets library release, 3.1.3,
   and Microsoft Studio Community 2017 compiler.

*) got rid of unnecessary wx-isms;
   now using modern c++11 features when it simplifies the code

*) used three different static code analyzers (MSVS 2017's built-in static
   analyzer, cppcheck, and clang-tidy) and followed up many many suggestions,
   though not all. Those that were painful, overly pedantic, or I didn't
   agree with have been ignored for now.

*) A typo was fixed in error_table.cpp for error 73; it now reads "SAVE DCF"
   instead of "SAVE SCF".

   A few missing error codes which were added for MVP operation were also
   added to the table.

*) The VP CPU disassembler (used only during emulation debug) had an error
   decoding the "MVX" pseudo-opcode. It was being decoded as "MVXX"
   (two places were marking the eXtended trait).  The disassembly of the
   stack transfer instructions (eg, TSP, TPS, XPS) were changed to match
   the Wang assembler, which unexpectedly swaps the order of operands for
   this set of instructions.

---- Tips ----

*) If you are using the OS X version of wangemu and you find that some keys
   repeat when you hold them down (eg, "a") and others don't (eg "b"), it
   is tied to an OS X feature where holding down a key will cause the OS
   to present a pop-up menu with various character accent options. Under
   wangemu, that popup menu does not appear, but it does interfere with key
   autorepeat.

   The emulator sets a per-application preference indicating that it desires
   auto-repeat when a key is held down, but that takes lower priority than
   the global setting for this preference.

   To see if this global preference is set, type:

         defaults read -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled

   If you get a response of "1" then it means this setting has been enabled
   globally. This can be disabled, but it may affect other applications, so
   think carefully before changing it.

   Method 1: (not recommended)

     Disable this feature globally.  Open the Terminal application to get a
     command line prompt, and enter this:

         defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

     The problem with this is is disables it for all applications, even if
     that applications expressly tries to enable it.

   Method 2: (better)

     Open the Terminal application to get a command line prompt, and enter
     this:

         defaults delete -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled

     By default (I believe) the feature is enabled, so most apps will still get
     the accented character menu on long keypresses, but it allows individual
     applications, such as wangemu, to set an application-specific override to
     disable it.

*) The emulator allows redirecting the printer output to a real, physically
   attached printer. The dialog offers two choices: LPT1 and LPT2.
   Just about no PCs these days support parallel ports. The following
   instructions are now to map a USB port to one of those logical printer
   ports. However, these directions worked on one PC in particular, and
   may need tweaking to get it to work for other systems (or maybe doesn't
   work at all):

   From a command prompt, use the command
       NET USE LPT1: \\JIM-580\HP-920 /PERSISTENT:YES
   to map LPT1 to the named network printer. "JIM-580" is the network name
   of my PC, and "HP-920" is the name of the attached USB printer.
   Obviously change those for your situation.

   However, this doesn't quite work because the emulator will send a
   simple stream of ASCII characters as if it was talking to a dumb printer,
   but the USB printer expects to receive some higher level (HP?) protocol.
   The next part tells the PC to map it to whatever the printer is expecting.

    + Go to "Devices and Printers" control panel.
    + Select the "Add a printer" menu at the top.
    + Specify "Add a local printer"
    + Under "Use an existing port:", select the one corresponding to your USB
      printer ("USB001" in my case); press "Next"
    + It now asks to install the printer driver. Under Manufacturer, pick
      "Generic". Under Printers, pick "Generic / Text Only"; press "Next"
    + Select "use the driver that is currently installed"
      (at least, that is what I did); press "Next"
    + Time to create a printer name. I made mine "USB-ASCII"; press "Next"
    + From a dos prompt, type
        NET USE LPT2: \\<machine_name>\USB-ASCII /PERSISTENT:YES
      It should reply "The command completed successfully".
    + From the Wang 2200 emulator printer windows, select LPT2 as the real
      printer to direct output to.
    + In my case, I had to do "SELECT LIST 015" to get the Wang to put out a
      line feed after each carriage return. The 215 device just ends each line
      with a CR and no LF.
    + If the program ends without filling the last page, you may need to send a
      HEX(0C) (page feed) to the printer to flush out the partial page.

---- Known Bugs ----

*) A real MVP allowed up to three MXD terminal mux cards to be installed
   supporting up to 12 terminals. The emulator allows only one MXD terminal
   because (a) managing four windows is already unwieldy, and (b) for some
   reason the OS hangs if more than one emulated MXD was active and I didn't
   feel like investing the effort to debug it because of issue (a).

*) Because of limitations in the wxSound implementation on OSX, a program
   such as this emits a choppy alert tone instead of continuous one:
      10 PRINT HEX(07):GOTO 10

*) The emulator currently does not model attaching a printer to a serial
   terminal.

*) In 2336 terminal mode, the boundary between character cells when displaying
   graphic characters is noticeable. The fix would require a complete rewrite
   of the display generation code. Maybe this will be fixed the next release.

*) The real 2200 CPUs occasionally insert dummy microinstruction cycles
   to performs memory refresh. This isn't modeled in the emulator,
   so the emulator is about 3% faster than a real 2200.
