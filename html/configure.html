<h1>WangEmu Configuration Options</h1>

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The Wang emulator can be configured to emulate various system configurations.
There are five categories of items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#CPU">CPU configuration</a></li>
    <li><a href="#IO">I/O configuration</a></li>
    <li><a href="#CRT">CRT configuration</a></li>
    <li><a href="printer.html">Printer Configuration</a></li>
    <li><a href="#misc">Miscellaneous configuration</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon start of the emulator, a file, named <b><tt>wangemu.ini</tt></b> is
read to determine how the system should be configured.
The file is located in the same directory as the emulator executable.
During operation, the user can change the various configuration options,
and all are saved back to the <b><tt>wangemu.ini</tt></b> file when the user
closes the program.  This file is a straight text file and can be viewed
and modified by any text editor, although it is all too easy to corrupt
the file.  It is best to just use the emulator to change options.
</p>

<p>
The first time the program is run, or if it can't locate wangemu.ini,
or if the file exists but has errors, a warning message is produced.
</p>

<p><img src="img/ini_warning.png"  height="129" width="364" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
In this case the emulator is given a default configuration, consisting of:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>2200T CPU</li>
    <li>32 KB RAM</li>
    <li>one keyboard at I/O address 01</li>
    <li>one 64x16 display controller at I/O address 05</li>
    <li>one intelligent disk controller at I/O address 10</li>
    <li>one printer controller at I/O address 15</li>
</ul>

<p>
In all cases below that show the "System Configuration" dialog, there will
be three buttons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Revert</li>
    <li>OK</li>
    <li>Cancel</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the dialog first opens, the Revert button will be grayed out and all
options shown will reflect the present configuration.  When you make
your selections, the emulator is actually not affected until the OK button
is pressed.  If you decide you don't want to change the configuration,
you can either hit the Cancel button or press the standard close window
button in the title bar of the dialog.  Alternately, you can click the Revert
button to change the configuration settings back to match the present
configuration and start changing from there.
</p>

<h2><a name="CPU">CPU Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
The most significant variable is selecting which CPU to emulate.
The first Wang 2200 systems used the 2200A, 2200B, 2200C, 2200S, or 2200T
CPUs.  The differences between these were mostly the amount of microcode.
The emulator currently supports the 2200B and 2200T microcode sets.
</p>

<p>
The 2200 VP (and later models) used a number of different implementations
of the VP microarchitecture but were largely the same.  Select this
for 2200 VP emulation running Wang BASIC-2.  Note that the VP series
didn't have BASIC in ROM and instead required a boot disk containing the
BASIC microcode.  For VP emulation the system must have at least on
disk controller in order to load microcode.  For MVP emulation, the CPU must
be either the MVP-C or the MicroVP, and a 2236 MXD terminal mux must be
chosen (see later).
</p>

<p>
To configure how much RAM the machine has, from the top level menu pick
"Configure", then the submenu "Configure System...".  You should see
a window that looks something like this one:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config.png"  height="268" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
Click on the pull-down list item labeled "RAM" and pick how much RAM
you'd like your system to have:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_ram.png"  height="265" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
The RAM size options shown above are all the ones valid for a real 2200T
CPU.  When the emulator is configured with a 2200 VP CPU, the RAM
choices are different to reflect what was valid for that system.
</p>

<h2><a name="IO">I/O Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
The system emulated has six I/O slots.  What gets plugged into each
slot is up to the user.  Just like a real 2200, slots are completely
symmetric, meaning that any card can be plugged into any available slot.
</p>

<p>
Currently, there are only five types of I/O cards emulated:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>keyboard controller</li>
    <li>display controller (64x16)</li>
    <li>display controller (80x24)</li>
    <li>disk controller</li>
    <li>printer controller</li>
</ul>

<p>
In real life, most cards could be assigned to just about any address,
but certain addresses were the preferred for a given device type to reduce
system configuration troubles.  Also, certain devices had to be present at
certain I/O addresses, since at power up, the microcode expected an input
device at address 01 and an output address at 05.
</p>

<p>
Select "Configure/Configure System..." from the top-level menu and you'll
get this dialog:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config.png"  height="268" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
For each of the slots, you can pick one of the available card types.
For example, here's how to add an 80x24 display controller:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_iotype.png"  height="265" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
A card can be removed from a slot by selecting the "(vacant)" device
type for the slot.
</p>

<p>
After selecting the new device, the I/O address of the card will still
need to be assigned.  Click on the pull-down list for the I/O address
for the slot just modified; in this example,
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_ioaddr.png"  height="265" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
After making changes, either accept them by pressing the <b><tt>OK</tt></b>
button, or cancel your actions by pressing the <b><tt>Cancel</tt></b> button.
Optionally, you can abort your changes and start over by pressing the <b><tt>Revert</tt></b>
button.
</p>

<p>
If you press <b><tt>OK</tt></b> and there is something wrong with the
configuration you've set up, you'll get one of the following warning messages
explaining what is wrong.  The first two are self explanatory:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_warn_01.png"  height="131" width="476" alt="placeholder" /></p>
<p><img src="img/config_warn_05.png"  height="131" width="449" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
If you add a card to a slot but forget to assign an I/O address, you'll
see an error similar to the following message:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_warn_ioaddr.png"  height="131" width="366" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
If you assign the same address to two devices, you'll see a message
like this one:
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_warn_conflict.png"  height="131" width="484" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
As the configuration is edited, the dialog constantly checks if the
configuration makes sense.  If it doesn't, the middle confirmation button
will read "Not OK", and clicking it will produce one of the error messages
just presented.  If the configuration is legal, the
middle confirmation button will read either "OK" if the change can be made
without rebooting the emulated system (e.g., changing whether or not the
disk timing is emulated as realtime), or "OK, Reboot" if the change is more
significant (e.g., adding or removing a card).
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_ok_reboot.png"  height="265" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h2><a name="disk">Disk Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
If there is a disk controller present, the System Configuration dialog will
include a "Config" button to the right of the slot containing the disk
controller.  Clicking that button will bring up another dialog to set the
details of that disk controller.
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_disk.png"  height="239" width="458" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h3>Number of drives</h3>

<p>
The first part of the dialog is simple enough.  Each disk controller can
control up to four disk drives.  If the base address of the disk controller
is, say, /310, then the first drive is F/310, the second drive is R/310,
the third is F/350, and the fourth is R/350.  This is standard Wang BASIC
behavior.
</p>

<h3>Controller Type</h3>

<p>
The second section, Controller Type, requires more explanation.  For the
first generation machines, which used Wang BASIC, the disk controller was
"dumb", meaning it had a limit low level command capability, and it could
handle only single platter disks of up to 32K sectors.  Wang BASIC-2 added
the ability to address multi-platter disks, and could address up to 64K
sectors per platter.  This required an "intelligent" disk controller, and
it also came with some new disk channel commands, such as format disk
(for ease of use) and multi-sector disk-to-disk copy (to help performance).
</p>

<p>
In almost all cases, it is best to just pick the Intelligent disk controller.
When running in 2200B or 2200T mode the intelligent disk controller behaves
like a dumb disk controller, so there no down side.  When running in VP mode
and using large disk (more than one platter or more than 32K sectors) the
disk controller must be intelligent, so there is no choice.
</p>

<p>
There is one obscure case where you might want to pick the dumb mode.
As was stated, Wang BASIC could address only 32K sectors.  The disk catalog
and certain parts of the file structure contain 16 bit fields to hold a
sector address.  Since only 15 bits of this was needed to hold the sector
address, for some unknown reason Wang BASIC will clear bit 15 to 0 if the
disk in is the F drive, and will set bit 15 to 1 if it is in the R drive.
Wang BASIC ignores this bit when reading back the disk later, so no harm
done.  The difficulty comes when you use one of these disks with an
intelligent disk controller.  The intelligent disk controller does <b>not</b>
ignore bit 15, and so unexpected things can happen.  One option is to manually
set the controller to be dumb when handling these kinds of disks.
</p>

<h3>Warn on mismatch</h3>

<p>
The third section of the dialog should normally always be left selected.
If the disk controller is in dumb mode and a large format disk is "inserted"
into a virtual drive, a warning will be generated indicating that this is
probably not what you desire, since most of the disk will not be accessible
to the dumb controller.  Likewise, if a small disk is inserted into a virtual
drive with an intelligent controller, the emulator checks for the problem
mentioned in the previous paragraph.  If the problem exists, a warning is
produced, with an option for the emulator to rewrite the virtual disk image
with all the extranious bit 15's cleared.
</p>

<h2><a name="CRT">CRT Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
The appearance of the CRT portion of the emulation is controlled via the
"Display Configuration" dialog.  This dialog is invoked via the
"Configure/Configure Screen..." menu.  The dialog is shown here.
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_screen.png"  height="162" width="225" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
When selections are made on this dialog, the change is immediately reflected
in the emulated CRT display.
</p>

<h3>CRT Font</h3>

<p>
The emulator can use a few different font sizes using the system Courier
font.  This produces easy reading text but it has some drawbacks.
One drawback is that the original Wang font had characters that the system's
Courier font doesn't support or has only very rough equivalents for.
More importantly, part of the fun of emulation is trying to be authentic
as possible.  To that end, the dot matrix font used in WangEmu was
obtained by reading the character generator ROM from a real Wang 7011 CRT
controller.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/font_system.png"  height="110" width="218" alt="placeholder" />
        <br/>System Courier, 12 point</td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/font_wang.png"  height="116" width="217" alt="placeholder" />
        <br/>Wang Dot Matrix, 1:2 Scaling</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The Display menu can be used to choose whatever font size appeals most
to the user.  After changing the font size, it is likely that the
user will need to resize the CRT window to better match the emulated display
size.  Note too that the emulator maintains separate font choices
for when the emulator is in fullscreen mode and not; the dialog changes
only the selection for the current mode.
</p>

<h3>CRT Color</h3>

<p>
The default color scheme chosen for the Wang emulator is bright green on
very dark green.  This most closely matches the look of the Wang CRT
display.  However, the user can also change to use either the "white"
or "blue" color schemes.  The "blue" scheme seems like an unlikely
choice, except that it is quite readable, and there was an early Wang brochure
with a mocked up display that used that color scheme.
</p>

<p>
Here is what the three look like together:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/crt_green.png"  height="80" width="120" alt="placeholder" />
        <br/>green phosphor</td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/crt_white.png"  height="80" width="120" alt="placeholder" />
        <br/>white phosphor</td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/crt_blue.png"  height="80" width="120" alt="placeholder" />
        <br/>white on blue</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Contrast/Brightness</h3>

<p>
The sliders on the Display Configuration dialog roughly emulate the
contrast/brightness controls of an original Wang terminal.
</p>

<h2><a name="misc">Miscellaneous Configuration</a></h2>

<p>
There are a few configuration choices that don't fall into one of the broad
categories above.
</p>

<p>
Some of the configuration state is implicitly controlled.  Just
about all of the windows and dialogs of the emulator retain their size
and position between invocations.  The Wang emulator also maintains
the most recent directory where a text script file was read, where a screen
capture was most recently saved, where a virtual disk image was located,
and where printer output was saved.
</p>

<h3>Keyword Mode</h3>

<p>
The Wang 2226 keyboard had two modes of operation, controlled by a toggle
lever on the left side of the keyboard.  In "A/a" mode, the keyboard
acted much like a typewriter.  Shifted keys produced capital letters
and unshifted keys produce lower case letters.  If the mode switch was set
to "Keyword/A" mode, shifted keys produced keywords (e.g., "PRINT " and
"FOR "), while unshifted keys produced capital letters.
</p>

<p>
WangEmu supports 2226 keyboard emulation via a checkbox in the lower
left corner of the CRT display. The two modes are shown here:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/keyword1.png"  height="30" width="150" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/keyword2.png"  height="30" width="150" alt="placeholder" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Checking the box causes shifted letters to produce keywords and unshifted
letters to produce their capital letter.  Another way to toggle the
state is to select the "Configure/Keyword mode" menu item, or to use the
keyboard sequence Alt-K.
</p>

<p><img src="img/menu_config.png"  height="138" width="240" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h3>SF key toolbar</h3>

<p>
This item is a toggle that enables or disables the display of a toolbar
on the CRT window.  The toolbar contains a graphical depiction of
the 16 special function keys plus the EDIT key.  This toolbar is especially
useful on the Mac platform because the function keys aren't all available
nor do they work in concert with the shift key.
</p>

<p>
Here is what the top of the CRT window looks like without a toolbar:
</p>

<p><img src="img/no_toolbar.png"  height="65" width="696" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
and here is what it looks like with the toolbar enabled:
</p>

<p><img src="img/with_toolbar.png"  height="97" width="696" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
There are 16 special function keys; holding down the shift key while
clicking on one of the buttons produces the Wang special function keys
16 to 31.  Some of the buttons have a label above the special function
key number, just like a real Wang keyboard.  These show the effect
that the keys have in EDIT mode.
</p>

<p>
If the window is emulating a serial terminal (that is, it is connected to
a 2236 MXD terminal mux), the toolbar will look slightly different, as
a few more special function keys have had EDIT actions assigned to them.
</p>

<p><img src="img/2336_toolbar.png"  height="97" width="856" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h3>Fullscreen Mode</h3>

<p>
WangEmu normally runs in a window frame of a size chosen by the user.
The user may make the window as big or small as desired and WangEmu will
remember this.  No matter how large or small, though, this frame will
always have a title bar, a menu bar, a status bar, and left and right frame
margins.
</p>

<p>
By selecting the "Configure/Fullscreen" menu item, or by using the keyboard
shortcut Alt-Enter, WangEmu will toggle into and
out of fullscreen mode.  Fullscreen mode is where the program will
take over the whole computer screen.  It is different than a maximized
window in that there is no title bar, no status bar, and no left and right
margins.  This mode allows maximum use of screen real estate and comes
closes to emulating a real 2200 CRT.  Because the fullscreen vs. normal
sized window are likely to have very different sizes, WangEmu maintains
separate font style preferences for these two modes.
</p>

<p>
Logically this option should live in the Display Configuration dialog,
but since it is likely to be changed more often than those other CRT-related
options, it has been made more accessible to the user.
</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>
This dialog allows user control of whether or not emulation performance
statistics appear in the status bar of the CRT frame.
</p>

<p><img src="img/statistics.png"  height="52" width="291" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
For example, the statusbar above indicates that 752 emulated seconds of CPU
time had elapsed since the beginning of the simulation and that the emulation
was running at 43 times the speed of an actual Wang 2200.
</p>

<h3>Enable/Disable Warnings About Accesses to Unpopulated I/O Addresses</h3>

<p>
The Wang I/O structure supports 255 unique I/O addresses (address 0x00
is reserved to mean "address nothing.")  Programs can arbitrarily
attempt to perform I/O on any of these addresses.  Because the emulator
supports a limited number of I/O devices or may be configured differently
from the expectations of a running program, the emulator will by default
warn when a program selects an address that doesn't have a device at the
address.
</p>

<p>
Whether to warn or not is controlled globally by the flag on the System
Configuration menu, shown highlighted below.
</p>

<p><img src="img/config_warn_io.png"  height="268" width="628" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
The first time a given non-existent device is addressed, the following
warning will appear.  The user is given an option to ignore any further
complaints about that address, or to continue receiving them.  This
suppression exists until the next time the emulator is started.
</p>

<p><img src="img/warn_bad_io.png"  height="252" width="444" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<h3>Keyboard Tieing</h3>

<p>
This topic is an obscure corner case, so feel free to skip it unless you
have an unusual configuration with multiple 6367 keyboard controllers.
</p>

<p>
Although probably 99.9% of the Wang 2200's were used with a single keyboard
(that is, until the MVP came out), there was nothing to prevent a person
from plugging multiple keyboard controllers into one CPU.  WangEmu
also allows it.  However, that presents a problem, as a PC is even
more likely than an old 2200 to have a single keyboard.  WangEmu solves
this by allowing the user to specify where keystrokes directed to a given
CRT screen should map to in the range of keyboard addresses.
</p>

<p>
If the system is configured to have a single keyboard, then the emulator
assumes all keystrokes are to go to the single keyboard controller (which
must, be necessity, be at address 01), and the top level Configure menu
list looks like this:
</p>

<p><img src="img/menu_config.png"  height="138" width="240" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
However, say two keyboards are configured for the system, at I/O addresses
01 and 02.  The top level Configure menu changes to look like this:
</p>

<p><img src="img/menu_config2.png"  height="190" width="245" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
By selecting "Tie to /0nn", any keys typed while the window has focus
will be caught by the keyboard controller emulation at I/O address nn.
It is possible to have the input from one CRT to go to any of N different
keyboards, and it is also possible for N different CRT windows to get mapped
to a single keyboard controller, or anything in between.
