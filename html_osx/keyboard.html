<h1>WangEmu Keyboard Map</h1>

<p>
The Wang 2200 had a number of different keyboard options during
its life.  The earliest ones are best described as being more like
a calculator keyboard that had the letters retrofitted to it than a keyboard
meant for typing.  Later ones did have a more or less normal typewriter
layout augmented with some dedicated keys for performing common tasks.
</p>

<p>
One problem most emulators have is deciding how to map the emulated
keys onto the keys available on the host computer's keyboard.  Many
emulator writers attempt to map the emulated keys to the same positions
of the keyboard even if the key legend is very different (such that a
blindfolded user of the emulated computer would feel at home).  WangEmu takes
the other tack.  As much as possible, if a key with the right legend
is available on the host keyboard, that is the one used to represent the
equivalent 2200 key.
</p>

<p>
That still leaves some problems.  The Mac keyboard has many keys
that the 2200 (more correctly, the 2226 keyboard) didn't have, and the
2226 had some keys that the Mac keyboard doesn't have.  In these cases,
WangEmu tries to pick keys that are somewhat mnemonic.  Also, not
all keys were directly mapped since such a mapping was rarely used and
adding it to the emulator would cause more confusion than it was worth
(e.g., mapping "RENUMBER" to the shifted comma key, while accuate, would
have necessitated moving the "&lt;" symbol to some other obscure location).
</p>

<p>
Another matter is that there isn't complete standardization on keyboard
layouts.  This is especially true on the Mac platform.
Perhaps a future version of the emulator will allow for a user-configurable
key map, but for now, changing it requires editing the source code and
recompiling.
</p>

<h2>Special function keys and dedicated keyword keys</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, the Wang has 16 special function keys, while not all Mac
keyboards do.  OS X also steals some keys for various Expos&eacute;
functions; holding down the FN-key while pressing the indicated function
key will allow the emulator to see the function key press without the
side effects.
</p>

<p>
There are two other methods for getting function key presses to the emulator.
First, WangEmu can be configured to display a toolbar with all the special
function keys.
</p>

<p>
Second, special function keys used in the EDIT mode are also mapped to control
key combinations. For example, to enter the SF 13 key, which in edit mode
causes the cursor to move left one position, it is much more mnemonic to
press LEFT-ARROW (<span class="arrow">&larr;</span>).
</p>

<p>
Below is a complete table of the mappings.  In some cases, there
are two Mac keys or key combinations that are used to emulate a given
keystroke.  On the 2200, some of the special function keys get a dedicated
purpose when in edit mode, shown as the last column of the table.

<p>
Pressing the key or key sequence for SF0-SF15 in combination with the
SHIFT key will generate the codes for the 2200's special function 16 through
31 keys (the 2226 also had only 16 special function keys, SF0-SF15, and
SF16-SF31 were obtained by pressing SHIFT to add 16 to the special function
key number).
</p>

<p>
To recall and edit, say, line 500,
either of the following sequences can be used:
</p>

<p class="code">
500&lt;F16&gt;&lt;F15&gt;
</p>

<p class="code">
500&lt;press ctrl&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;F&gt;&lt;release ctrl&gt;
</p>

<h2>Keyword Keys</h2>

<p>
The 2226 keyboard had two modes of operation: "Keyword/A" and "A/a".
Which mode the keyboard was in was controlled by a toggle switch on the
left side of the keyboard.  This is controlled in the emulator in any of
three ways: the checkbox in the lower left corner of the emulated CRT window,
via the Configure/Keyword mode menu item, or with the
Cmd-K shortcut.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/keyword1.png"  height="34" width="100" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/keyword2.png"  height="34" width="100" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/menu_config.png"  height="123" width="185" alt="placeholder" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In "A/a" mode, the keyboard works pretty
much like a typewriter, with unshifted keys producing lower case letters
and shifted keys producing capital letters.  In "Keyword/A" mode,
unshifted keys produced capital letters while shifted keys produced BASIC
keywords.  Most of them have been preserved.

<hr/>

<p>
In 2236 mode (serial terminal), the Wang keyboard did not have a keyword mode.
Instead, the same switch just toggled between normal mode and caps-lock mode.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/keyword1b.png"  height="34" width="100" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>

</tr>
</table>

<hr/>

<p>
For both 2226 (dumb terminal) and 2236 (serial terminal) modes of operation,
a few keys couldn't be conveniently mapped to their Wang-like positions and
have been mapped to control keys.  Each (except CONTINUE) uses the first
letter of the word it maps as a convenient mnemonic.
</p>

<table class="keywords">
<thead>
<tr> <td>Mac key</td> <td>Keyword</td> </tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-C</td>  <td>CLEAR</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-L</td>  <td>LOAD</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-P</td>  <td>PRINT</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-R</td>  <td>RUN</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-Z</td>  <td>CONTINUE</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
A number of other keyboard shortcuts have been added to map keys that
don't appear on a Mac keyboard, or which are convenient 2nd choices
vs using the special function key toolbar.  The control key names try
to use a mnemonic letter, except for Ctrl-F (SF15/recall). This was chosen
because the [edit][recall] sequence is a frequent pair, and so Ctrl-[E][F]
is a quick action.
</p>

<p>
The odd man out is the RESET key, which was mapped to Shift-Cmd-R to make
it difficult to accidentally trigger.
</p>

<table class="keywords">

<tbody>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-E</td>       <td>edit mode toggle</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>Ctrl-F</td>       <td>edit mode recall</td> </tr>

<tr>  <td>Shift-Cmd-R</td>  <td>RESET</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
There are a few keyboard shortcuts that don't map to a real keyboard behavior;
rather, these are used to manage the emulation, not the emulated computer.

Finally, here is a diagram showing where all the keys are mapped,
at least on my keyboard.  Certain keys may appear in different locations
on different keyboards, especially European keyboards.
